        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Peacocks, scientifically known as Pavo cristatus, are
            large, colorful birds belonging to the pheasant family,
            Phasianidae. Native to the Indian subcontinent, peacocks
            are renowned for their vibrant plumage and elaborate courtship
            displays. Here are some key aspects of peacocks:</p>
        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Male Peafowls (Peacocks):</h3>The males are especially known for their striking 
                appearance. They possess a long, iridescent tail, or "train," which is not 
                actually part of the tail but elongated upper tail coverts. The train can be over 60% of the
                 birdâ€™s total body length and features eye-catching, colorful "eye spots." 
                These feathers can be fanned out in a spectacular display to attract mates.</li>
            <li><h3>Female Peafowls (Peahens): </h3> Females are smaller and less colorful than males, with a more 
                subdued brown and green plumage, which helps them blend into their surroundings while nesting.</li>
        </ul>
